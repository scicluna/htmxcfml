# HTMX Autocomplete Extension for VSCode
This Visual Studio Code extension provides rich autocomplete and hover-over documentation for HTMX attributes in CFML files. It aims to enhance productivity and understanding of HTMX by offering quick access to attribute descriptions and valid values directly in the editor.

## Features
Autocomplete for HTMX Attributes: Offers suggestions for HTMX attributes as you type in CFML files, helping you to write code faster and with fewer errors.
Hover-over Documentation: When you hover over an HTMX attribute, you'll see a detailed description of what it does, allowing for a better understanding of HTMX without leaving the editor.
Autocomplete for hx-swap Values: Specific support for hx-swap attribute values, presenting you with the valid options and their descriptions.
